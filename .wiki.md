# Project Summary
The project is a web application designed for inventory and forecast management, aimed at improving business operations through effective data handling. It leverages Supabase as a backend for CRUD operations on a central "master" table and a "forecast" table, with a focus on user experience and data visibility. Recent updates include enhancements to the Calendar Master module, allowing users to view and edit calendar data side-by-side from two tables, and a new automated "Clear Cache & Restart" feature.

# Project Module Description
The application consists of several functional modules:
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage inventory and forecast records by adding, editing, and deleting entries.
- **Forecast Management**: Month-based operations with a custom MonthPicker for filtering records.
- **Calendar Master**: View and edit calendar data from "calender1" and "calender2" tables, including inline editing for working and overtime hours.
- **Real-time Database Interaction**: Connects to Supabase for live data updates.
- **User Notifications**: Provides toast notifications for success and error messages during data operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the interface is functional across various devices.
- **Configuration Check**: Validates Supabase credentials and guides users through setup if not configured.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Offers a theme toggle for light, dark, and system preferences.
- **Price Formatting**: Displays prices in Indonesian Rupiah (Rp) with proper formatting.
- **Navigation Menu**: A collapsible left sidebar for easy navigation between Master Data, Forecast, and Calendar pages.
- **CSV Upload Enhancements**: Intelligent delimiter detection and header recognition for CSV files.
- **Automated Restart**: A feature that clears cached data and restarts the application with a single command.
