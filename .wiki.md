# Project Summary
The project is a web application for inventory and forecast management, enhancing business operations through efficient data handling. It utilizes Supabase as a backend for CRUD operations on a central "master" table and a "forecast" table, focusing on user experience and data visibility. Recent enhancements include the addition of new pages for "Actual" and "Monitoring" and improvements to the Calendar Master module.

# Project Module Description
The application includes several functional modules:
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage inventory and forecast records by adding, editing, and deleting entries.
- **Forecast Management**: Month-based operations with a custom MonthPicker for filtering records.
- **Calendar Master**: View and edit calendar data from "calender1" and "calender2" tables, including inline editing for working and overtime hours.
- **New Pages**: 
  - **Actual**: Placeholder for future content.
  - **Monitoring**: Placeholder for future content.
- **Real-time Database Interaction**: Connects to Supabase for live data updates.
- **User Notifications**: Provides toast notifications for success and error messages during data operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the interface is functional across various devices.
- **Configuration Check**: Validates Supabase credentials and guides users through setup if not configured.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Offers a theme toggle for light, dark, and system preferences.
- **Price Formatting**: Displays prices in Indonesian Rupiah (Rp) with proper formatting.
- **Navigation Menu**: A collapsible left sidebar for easy navigation between Master Data, Forecast, Calendar, Actual, and Monitoring pages.
- **CSV Upload Enhancements**: Intelligent delimiter detection and header recognition for CSV files.
- **Automated Restart**: A feature that clears cached data and restarts the application with a single command.
